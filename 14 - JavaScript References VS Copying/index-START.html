    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // const team = players;
    // team[3] = "Noob";

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    // const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // const team4 = [...players]
    // team4[3] = "Noob";
    // console.log(team4);
    // console.log(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // const team5 = Array.from(players);
    
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    // const person = {
    //   name: 'Sheraz',
    //   age: 80
    // };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const him = person;
    // him.age = "99";

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // const him = Object.assign({}, person);
    // him.age = 25;
    // him.number = 3;
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const him = {...person};
    // him.age = 25;
    // him.number = 3;

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const person = {
      name: 'Sheraz',
      age: 25,
      social: {
        linkedin: "sherazmalik-se",
        github: "sherazmalik-se"
      }
    };

    // const him = {...person}
    // const him = Object.assign({}, person)
