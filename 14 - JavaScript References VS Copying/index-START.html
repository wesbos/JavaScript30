    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200 100

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // wes wes
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2) // wesley wes
    
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // console logging players shows that both are the same.
    

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team is equal to players

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee haww';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Web Bos',
      age: 80
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; // we just made a reference
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes', 
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@webbos',
        facebook: 'webbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    //when you use object.assign, it only goes 1 level deep, so you'll need to clone deep to clone every level as deep as you want
    
    //poor man's deep clone
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    // this works because it converts the object to a string and we parse it to turn it back into an object
